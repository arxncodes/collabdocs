## Tips & Tricks

### 1. Use Descriptive Titles

**Good**: "React useState Hook Example"  
**Bad**: "Code 1"

Descriptive titles make searching easier!

### 2. Organize with Categories

Keep similar content together by using the right category. This makes filtering much faster.

### 3. Keep Content Concise

Snippets work best when they're focused and reusable. Break large content into multiple snippets.

### 4. Use Search Effectively

- Search for **keywords** that appear in your content
- Try different search terms if you don't find what you're looking for
- Remember: search looks in both title AND content

### 5. Create Templates

Store templates for common tasks:
- Email responses
- Meeting notes
- Code boilerplates
- Standard paragraphs

### 6. Regular Cleanup

Periodically review and delete snippets you no longer use to keep your library organized.
