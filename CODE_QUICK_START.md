# Quick Start Guide - Code Collaboration

## Getting Started with Code Collaboration

### Step 1: Access Code Dashboard

1. Log in to your account
2. Click **"My Codes"** in the sidebar (💻 icon)
3. You'll see your code dashboard

### Step 2: Create Your First Code Document

1. Click the **"+ New Code"** button
2. Enter a title (e.g., "Hello World")

   - 🟨 JavaScript
   - 🐍 Python
   - ☕ Java
   - And 13 more!
4. Click **"Create"**
5. You're now in the code editor!

### Step 3: Start Coding

The editor works just like VS Code:

**Features**:
- ✅ Syntax highlighting (automatic)
- ✅ Auto-completion (IntelliSense)
- ✅ Bracket matching
- ✅ Code folding
- ✅ Minimap (right side)
- ✅ Line numbers

**Example Code**:

```javascript
// JavaScript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet("World");
```

```python
# Python
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("World")
```

### Step 4: Saving Your Code

**Auto-Save** (Automatic):
- Saves every 2 seconds after you stop typing
- Watch for status: "Saving..." → "All changes saved"

**Manual Save** (On Demand):
- Click the **Save** button (💾)
- Or press **Ctrl+S** (Windows/Linux) or **Cmd+S** (Mac)

**Status Indicators**:
- 🟡 "Unsaved changes" - You have edits
- ⚪ "Saving..." - Save in progress
- 🟢 "All changes saved" - Everything is saved

### Step 5: Collaborate with Others

2. Invite collaborators via email
3. They can edit in real-time!

**Collaboration Features**:
- See who's online (avatars at top)
- Each user has a unique color
